Module 5

1. Create a class that describes a triangle. It should be defined by using three points which describe the vertexes of this
triangle. Create a method that is able to calculate the are of the triangle: it should return a double value (an area) and should
throw an exception if the area could not be calculated (for example if the triangle is self-intersecting).
Create a simple class which will use the triangle class.
Note: the exception should be Checked.

2. Extends the Banking application from a previous module to support exceptions: it should throw a RuntimeException if we
are going to replenish the account with a negative value.
